<h1>1 Star:</h1>

Bonus Payload - Paste `<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/771984076&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=true&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>` into the search bar

Bully Chatbot - Just ask the chatbot to give coupon.

Confidential Document - Went to robots.txt, it said disallow /ftp. So went to /ftp, then downloaded acquisitions.md

DOM XSS - Pasting `<iframe src="javascript:alert('xss')">` into the search bar in the top right solves this challenge.

Error Handling - Entered email as ' and random password, and got the achievement (SQLi).

Exposed Metrics - Read the prometheus paper provided, and saw /metrics endpoint. Tried that, cause it shared the name of the challenge, and solved it.

Mass Dispel - Didn't really know how to do this, so googled it. I found the juice shop help website, and there it said that shift-clicking one of the X buttons would close all.

Missing Encoding - Went to the photo wall, and saw a photo which wasn't loading. Used inspect element to check it out and saw that the URL wasn't encoded. Put the URL in a URL encoder, and it encoded the `#` and the emoji. However, this still didn't load the image. So I put the emoji back as is, and image loaded.

Outdated Allowlist - Looked at the source code for cryptocurrency addresses. I searched for `redirect`. Found a blockchain url redirect. Pasted that into the search bar.

Privacy Policy - Just navigate to Account > Privacy and Security > Privacy Policy.

Repetitive Registration - While registering, I entered a password, then repeated that same password. Then I edited the original password without changing the repeat password. It didn't show any error, so I registered and got the achievement.

Score Board - Looked through the source code `main.js`, searched for keyword `score`, found `score-board` as an endpoint.

Web3 Sandbox - Searched for sandbox in source code, found path as `web3-sandbox`, put that in URL.

Zero Stars - Went to network section of devtools, copied the POST request of feedback form as cURL, got a script and changed the value of rating to 0 and ran that script.

<h1>2 Stars:</h1>

Admin Section - Found path `administration` in the source code, but I wasn't allowed to access it. Used SQLi (`' OR 1=1--`) payload to login as admin. Then accessed the administration section.

Deprecated Interface - (Had to use a tutorial for this) Going to the complaint section, I saw only file types allowed to be uploaded were pdf and zip. Searching for `application/pdf` in the source code, I found that xml files were also allowed to be uploaded. Hence uploaded xml file.

Empty User Registration - Went to the network tab, and copied as cURL the registration POST request. Changed the email and password to ''.

Five-Star Feedback - Logged in as admin, went to the administration section, and deleted all 5 star reviews.

Login Admin - Completed in the Admin Section challenge.

Login MC SafeSearch - Found the email in the administration section `mc.safesearch@juice-sh.op`. Googled Mc SafeSearch, found his song and it said he put his password as `Mr. N00dles`.

Meta Geo Stalking - Got his email from the administration section. Got a picture of his favourite hiking place from the photo wall. Used exiftool on the picture, got the cords, put it in google maps, and found the location.

NFT Takeover - In the About Us section, there was a slide with certain words (`purpose betray marriage blame crunch monitor spin slide donate sport lift clutch`), and asking for juicy nfts. In the source code, there was a path `juicy-nft`. Going there and entering the words, it prompts for a Ethereum key. I found a site which converts seed words to Ethereum key, and used that to solve the challenge.

Password Strength - Admin email found on the administration page, password I just guessed.

Reflected XSS - Thought maybe editting username or something with XSS payload would work. That didn't, so I was just playing around, trying to figure out where I could insert the payload. Clicked on the `Your Basket` button, placed an order to see what would happen, and then changed the id in the track order field to the XSS payload for reflected XSS.

Security Policy - Did not understand what to do in this, so I looked it up. It's good practice to have a security.txt. The site securitytxt.org says the security.txt file should be placed under the path `/.well-known/security.txt`. Going to this path solved the challenge.

View Basket - Viewed my basket, copied the request as cURL, and changed the basket id to some other random number.

Visual Geo Stalking - Got email address from administration page, zooming in on the image on the photo wall, you see a flyer that says ITsec. Use that to answer her security question.

Weird Crypto - Had to look this up as well. Looking at github source code, there is a file called insecurity.js. There it shows that md5 is being used for hashing, which is very insecure. Entering this in the feedback window, we complete the challenge.

<h1>3 Stars:</h1>

API-only XSS - Looked up what persisted XSS was. I intercepted the request, used a script and performed XSS using a json and POST request, to the api/Products endpoint.

Admin Registration - Going to user registration page and intercepting the request, I saw a role attribute. Used a script and changed it to admin.

Bjoernâ€™s Favorite Pet - I googled Bjoern's favourite pet, and it showed up as Zaya, though this could be due to the fact its a widely solved challenge.

CAPTCHA Bypass - Copied the POST request as cURL, and saw that there was a `captchaId` and `answer`. Just put this in a 10 iteration loop and got the achievement.

Client-side XSS Protection - Sent payload in the email section of json in the script.

CSRF - Used the following script in the link given to us in the description. This code changes the username from another origin. It worked, but I didn't get the achievement for some reason.

```<form action="http://localhost:3000/profile" method="POST">
  <input name="username" value="CSRF Wooo"/>
  <input type="submit"/>
</form>
<script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>```

Deluxe Fraud - The payment button is grayed out. Using inspect element, I removed the disabled attribute, then clicked the button and copied the request. Then I changed payment mode from wallet to blank.

Forged Feedback - Sent feedback, and copied the request. Then I changed the User id and ran the script.

Forged Review - Similar to Forged Feedback, changed email to random email.

Login Amy - I googled One Important Final Note, and got to know about password padding. Amy didn't read the note, so she padded the password in the exact same way as given in the website. Seeing as Amy didn't do this, I wrote a script to vary the first letter with A-Z, second with 0-9, and last with a-z, and `K1f.....................` was the password.

Login Bender - Simple SQLi, just commenting out the password using `--` works.

Login Jim - Same as Login Bender

Manipulate Basket - Copied request, and changed BasketId to something else. That didn't work, so added a secondary BasketId and sent the request, and it worked.

Payback Time - Copied request, and changed quantity of item to -1234. Then placed the order via UI

Privacy Policy Inspection - (Did not get this, looked at a tutorial) Going back to the Privacy policy, and looking through it, certain words, lit up with a fire effect. We had to note down all the words and combine them into a URL.

Product Tampering - Changed href using XSS in copied request. `{"description": "<a href=\'https://owasp.slack.com\' target=\'_blank\'>More...</a>"}`

Reset Jim's Password - Security question is "Your eldest sibling's middle name". Reading his reviews, we see he's a fan of Star Trek. So googling Jim Star Trek, we get James T. Kirk. James T. Kirk's brother's name is George Samuel Kirk. Hence answer to the security question is Samuel.

Upload Size - Copy the request, and pass a file that is greater than 100 kB, but less than 200 kB.

Upload Type - Same as Upload Size, just upload xml.
