<h2>Q1. What is the purpose of  `__xyz__` double underscored variables stuff in python?</h2>

Magic methods, or dunders (double underscores) in python are defined by built-in classes in Python, and are commonly used for operator overloading. One can use dunder methods to customize the behavior of common operations such as +, -, *, **, ==, %, @ and more. These methods don't have to be explicitly called, and are automatically called when certain operators and / or operations are used.


```python
class calc:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
    
    def __add__(self, n2):
        return self.n - n2.n
    
    def __sub__(self, n2):
        return self.n + n2.n
    
    def __mul__(self, n2):
        return self.n * n2.n

n1 = calc(10)
n2 = calc(5)

n3 = n1 + n2
n4 = n1 - n2
n5 = n1 * n2

print(n3)
print(n4)
print(n5)

```

Output:
```
5
15
50
```

In this code, I overwrote the meanings of the operators `+` and `-` using dunders and interchanged them for chaotic purposes. But yeah, dunders mainly allow you to edit such common functionalities as your program calls for it.

<h2>Q2. Read up on all of these, try them out in python console, and write a brief expl + a code snippet showing their usage for the top 10(in solving chals) important ones among them according to your research.</h2>

```python
__init__,__del__,__repr__,__str__,__call__,__len__,__getitem__,__setitem__,__delitem__,__iter__,__next__,__getattr__,__setattr__,__delattr__,__dir__,__enter__,__exit__,__bool__,__format__,__doc__,__class__,__module__,__bases__,__import__,__name__,__qualname__,__annotations__,__dict__,__slots__,__weakref__,__reduce__,__reduce_ex__,__copy__,__deepcopy__,__slots__,__mro__,__globals__,__builtins__
```

According to me, the top 10 are:

<h3>1. `__init__`</h3>

The most commonly used dunder, used for initialization of an object after it has been created. It is automatically called when an object is created.

```python
class calc:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        print (self.n)

n1 = calc("hello")
```

Output:
```
hello
```

(Mostly used for initializing, another dunder is used for printing. Just wanted to show how its automatically invoked when an object is created.)

<h3>2. `__str__`</h3> 

This method returns a string representation of an object. It is invoked by the print() function or the str() function.

```python
class calc:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
    
    def __str__(self):
        return "Hello World"

n1 = calc("Anything byt hello world")
print (n1)
```

Output:

```
Hello World
```

<h3>3. `__call__`</h3>

This allows a classâ€™s instance to be called like a function, not a method.

```python
class calc:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
    
    def __call__(self, n2):
        return self.n * n2

n1 = calc(10)
n2 = n1(5)
print (n2)
```

Output:
```
50
```

<h3>4. `__getitem__`</h3>
